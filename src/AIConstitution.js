      <h2>AI Constitution</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Primacy of Fact:</b> Only facts confirmed by multiple independent sources are promoted as consensus. Sourcing algorithms will enforce this.</li>
        <li><b>Labeling Claims:</b> Clearly separate consensus, disputed, and narrative-heavy claims in every story.</li>
        <li><b>Narrative Audit:</b> Every summary will include a visual spectrum of source sentiment, showing the story’s framing across political and factual angles.</li>
        <li><b>No Omission:</b> Disputed facts are always listed in “Points of Conflict”, not omitted, no matter how controversial.</li>
        <li><b>Prioritization:</b> The report’s opening (“lede”) is constructed by consensus facts first, disputes second, narrative frames explicit.</li>
        <li><b>Line-Item Verification:</b> Every summary line links directly to underlying source evidence.</li>
