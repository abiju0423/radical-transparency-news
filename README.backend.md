# Radical Transparency News: Backend Blueprint

This backend will handle:
- News aggregation and ingestion from APIs (NewsAPI, custom scrapers, fact-checking sources)
- Claim extraction and normalization (AI/NLP pipeline)
- Claim consensus/dispute detection
- Narrative spectrum and sentiment analysis
- API endpoints for frontend to fetch stories, reports, and source breakdowns
- User accounts and feed/prefs storage (eventually scalable, e.g., PostgreSQL)

Starter code and API skeleton will follow in `/src`.
