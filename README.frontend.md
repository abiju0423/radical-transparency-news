# Radical Transparency News: Project Frontend Structure

This will be the main React-based code split for the user interface, supporting:
- Topic section navigation (Politics, Finance, Tech, Wildlife, etc.)
- News search and personalized feeds
- Transparency Report for each story (AI Glass Box, Synthesized Article, Points of Conflict, Narrative Spectrum, Full Source List, etc.)
- User preferences & login
- Claim Explorer (on-click sourcing for each summary line)

A full UI blueprint and starter code will follow in `/src`.
